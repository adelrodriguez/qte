Initial implementation of the qte library: parse human-readable time expressions into any unit, and format durations into human-readable strings. Includes `parse`, `format`, `isTimeExpression`, eight unit functions (`ms`, `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `months`, `years`), and public conversion constants.
